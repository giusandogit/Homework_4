"step 4c modification" has been committed because there was a listener for step 4c 
which resulted to be not necessary for the task to be accomplished, so it was taken out of the compiled code.

It is possible to uncomment it easily in order to run the original committed code
(check tf_nav.h and tf_nav.cpp)
